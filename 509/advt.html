        <h2 align="center">ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>ADVANTAGES</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Increases Production and Saves Time</li>
            <li>Improves Communication </li>
            <li>Improves Data Storage, File Management, and Data Reporting/ Analysis</li>
            <li>Improves Financial Management</li>
            <li>Improves Business to Consumer Relationship</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>DISADVANTAGES</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Small businesses sometimes struggle to afford and maintain expensive core technology, so they end up losing their clients to a company which has the capital and resources necessary to compete in the industry.</li>
            <li>Technology has replaced many positions humans used to occupy. Software is now doing complete accounting, so trained accountants have fewer opportunities, robots can cut the lawn or clean the pools, no need for a handyman.</li>
            <li>Since businesses store their data on remote cloud servers which can be accessed online with a username and password, they risk potentially losing that data to hackers or viruses.</li>
