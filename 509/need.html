        <p>India’s Information Technology Act, 2000 or IT Act, is a subject of contention and controversy. As it is amended, it contains some of the most stringent privacy requirements in the world and has the unfortunate impact of holding intermediaries liable for illegal content.

            You can read the contents of the law act here.
            
            If you operate from/in India, you need to understand the IT Act in order to avoid potential penalties.
            
            This overview will discuss the provisions and requirements set forth in the IT Act and a compliance checklist so your privacy and data protection strategies are planned correctly with the context of this law.</p>
            <p>The IT Act of 2000 passed in a budget session of parliament and signed by President K.R. Narayanan in 2000. It underwent further finalization by India’s Minister of Information Technology, Pramod Mahajan.

                The original act addressed electronic documents, e-signatures, and authentication of those records. It also enacted penalties for security breach offenses including damaging computer systems or committing cyber terrorism. Regulating authorities received power to monitor these situations and draft rules as situations arose.</p><a href="advt.html">Next page</a>
