        <p>Information Technology Act 2000, is to provide legal recognition for transactions carried out by means of electronic data 
     interchange and other means of electronic communication, commonly referred to as “electronic commerce”,
     which involve the use of alternatives to paper-based methods of communication 
     The Information Technology Act, 2000 (also known as ITA-2000, or the IT Act) is an Act of the Indian Parliament (No 21 of 2000)
     notified on 17 October 2000. It is the primary law in India dealing with cybercrime and electronic commerce.
     is based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial 
     Arbitration recommended by the General Assembly of United Nations by a resolution dated 30 January 1997.
     On 2 April 2015, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis revealed to the state assembly that a new law was 
     being framed to replace the repealed Section 66A. Fadnavis was replying to a query Shiv Sena leader Neelam Gorhe. Gorhe had said 
     that repeal of the law would encourage online miscreants and asked whether the state government would frame a law to this regard.
     Fadnavis said that the previous law had resulted in no convictions, so the law would be framed such that it would be strong and result
     in convictions.On 13 April 2015, it announced that the Ministry of Home Affairs would form a committee of officials from the 
     Intelligence Bureau, Central Bureau of Investigation, National Investigation Agency,
      Delhi Police and ministry itself to produce a new legal framework. This step was reportedly taken after complaints from intelligence agencies
       that, they were no longer able to counter online posts that involved national security matter or incite people to commit an offence, 
        such as online recruitment for ISIS. Former Minister of State with the Ministry of Information Technology, 
     Milind Deora has supported a new "unambiguous section to replace 66A". </p>
